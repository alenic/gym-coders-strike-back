# gym-coders-strike-back

This environment is an implementation of the [Coders Strike Back](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back) contest, hosted by the [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com) website.

Actually only a single game mode is implemented,  i.e. you can control only one pod through a random sets of chekpoints, and the game is done when you reach the final checkpoint. The reward mechanism is very simple, you receive -1 for every tick of the game.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alenic/gym-coders-strike-back
